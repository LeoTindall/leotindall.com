I write a lot of software. Not all of it is production quality, but I like to make it public so that others can benefit from my work.

### Reusable Code Libraries

* [libui-rs](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs) - a Rust interface providing cross platform access to native UI frameworks.
* [helicase](https://github.com/LeoTindall/helicase) - read and write strings of DNA bases, and convert them to framed strands or polypeptides.
* [sbrain](https://github.com/LeoTindall/sbrain) - a 25-symbol programming language specification and VM implementation, in Rust.
* [MLeM](https://github.com/LeoTindall/mlem) - the Machine Learning Machine, a virtual machine designed as an ML target.
* [update-rate](https://github.com/LeoTindall/update_rate) - a low-overhead update counter for high-performance applications.
* [workctl](https://github.com/LeoTindall/workctl) - a set of higher-level abstractions for controlling concurrent/parallel programs.
* [whiteout](https://github.com/LeoTindall/whiteout) - provides macros that erase the type of any value into an `impl Trait` for a given trait.

### Web Applications

* [Open Energy Dashboard](https://openenergydashboard.github.io) - a web application that ingests, stores, and allows users to analyze data from smart energy meters.
* [RFortune](https://github.com/leotindall/rfortune) - a web application written in Rust which displays random quotes to the user. A proof of concept for Rocket web apps.
* [Silvr](https://github.com/LeoTindall/silvr) - a SQLite-based blogging application, written in Python with Flask.

### Graphical Applications

* [RandomUA](/randomua/) - a WebExtension that changes your User-Agent string to a sensible-looking UA string which is different for every request.
* [Silver Smuggler](https://github.com/LeoTindall/silver_smuggler) - a QT app for the XOR "cipher".

### Security & Administration Tools

* [harf](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/harf) - the HTTP Watchdog. `harf` barks when your services go down.
* [RLoris](https://github.com/LeoTindall/rloris) - a concurrent and parallel implementation of RSnake's SlowLoris application level DoS attack on many web servers (like Apache).
* [PyPlotPing](https://github.com/LeoTindall/FlameTools) - a Python application to plot data from the `ping` command, for finding network faults.

### Command Line Tools

* [counted-rs](https://github.com/LeoTindall/counted-rs) - a command line interface to fetch CSV-formatted data from The Guardian's [database](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/jun/01/the-counted-police-killings-us-database) of police shootings in the US.
* [evolve-sbrain](https://github.com/LeoTindall/evolve-sbrain) - an evolutionary algorithm for finding computer programs which conform to given specifications.
* [PyParens](https://github.com/LeoTindall/pyparens) - a toy Lisp language that executes in a Python context, with full interoperation.
* [GenevaBot](https://github.com/LeoTindall/genevabot) - a Python script that builds a statistical replica of a given Tumblr blog.

### Embedded Applications

* [esp8266_scan](https://gist.github.com/LeoTindall/c328e47e47cafc0be353feec020175af) - a wireless scanner code for the ESP8266 chip, which produces either JSON or human-readable output.

### Games

* [RaptorDown](https://github.com/LeoTindall/RaptorDown) - a rogue-like game I built in 24 hours for CodeDay San Diego.
