My journey into VR development is over, for now. Classes have begun and I no longer have access to my VR capable computer, for the moment anyway - but I'm definitely going to carry forward the lessons I learned during the last three months.

## In The Beginning

The moment I put on the VR headset for the first time was an absolutely incredible experience, but I didn’t really understand the power of virtual reality until after a few weeks into my study of existing VR experiences. I downloaded Google Earth VR and helped my mother (a Chinese historian) navigate virtually around the area of China she was studying for her latest book. Both of us came out of it with a much better understanding of the real geography than could be gleaned from a simple map or even a non-VR 3D system.

I realized then that VR is able to transform existing educational and simulatory content (such as the Google Earth 3D terrain data) into much more useful and engaging material that can inform and enhance existing curricula and, perhaps, create entirely new opportunities for learning.

## Learning Holistically 

The process of learning all the aspects of VR development - 3D modelling, programming, gameplay design, and interaction design - helped me understand how important the ability to integrate completely disparate skills is to the practice of the liberal arts. Without any of the various requisite parts, I wouldn’t have been able to even make a start at building a cohesive whole.

I also learned a lot about how difficult even seemingly simple projects are. The first level of Rebound, the game I partially completed, required no fewer than 120 3D models, 10 sound effects (each of which took several hours to get right), and would have required 50-100 textures (images mapped onto 3D objects) if I had reached that stage. While all this was very time consuming, the real problem was that each of the objects had to fit into the overall theme of the level, meaning that there was a constant feedback loop between 3D modelling, programming, and level design.

For example, I’d build a 3D model of a box, place it somewhere in the level, and put the headset on to try it out. I’d see that the ball didn’t correctly bounce off the box, so I’d go back to Blender and adjust the model. I would continue with this until I got the ball to bounce realistically. Then I would try different locations in the level to place the box for maximum atmospheric effect. Once I had done that, I’d reconsider the aesthetics of the model - surface details, color, et cetera - in the new spatial context, and go back to Blender again to readjust those details.

Any large project must have such a feedback loop, especially one involving multiple areas of expertise. This is one reason a broad education is important; had I been working on a team, a situation that would likely have lead to me hyperspecializing in coding rather than learning about 3D modelling, conceptual design, and level design as well, I would have been unable to effectively make or realize cohesive designs or to work well with other hyperspecialized team members. This experience will definitely translate into other areas of work.

## Failure, or Success?

In one sense, I definitely failed - I didn't complete _Rebound_'s first level, and I wasn't able to publish it and distribute it to my friends and the world at large. In another sense, however, I was successfully. I learned most of what I set out to learn. Firstly, of course, I gained an extremely diverse set of technical skills: C# programming, working with the Unity3D and VRTK application programming interfaces, and creating 3D models with Blender. I also learned a lot about how users interact with unfamiliar computer interfaces, a very valuable skill for someone creating user-facing applications software.

More abstractly, I learned a lot about how to manage and estimate time on projects that aren’t amenable to simple, accurate estimation, and how to integrate disparate disciplines into a cohesive whole.

## Moving forward

This year (2017-2018), I’d like to delve more into interaction and conceptual design. My creative writing course this semester will be helpful in this aim, as will my continued personal exploration of nonlinear storytelling through the Inform and Twine interactive fiction systems.

This coming summer and next year I want to combine those skills with a renewed focus on 3D design, perhaps revisiting Rebound or creating a new, more story-driven VR experience.

I'd like to give a huge thanks to FEG coordinator Christina Parente, my FEG coach Emily Sager, and the whole LAPC crew for making this possible.
