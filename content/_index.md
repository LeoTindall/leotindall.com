I used agile methodology to work with a small team, gaining experience with Go and the 
inner workings of Docker in a Service Oriented Architecture environment. I created a
developer tooling used for onboarding and external (SDK) development.

## âš– Ethics
It is the duty of software engineers to build software in an ethical way. In short:

- computer systems should serve their users before their makers
- software should empower users, not restrict them
- users should decide how data is used before engineers or businesspeople

Whether it means embracing software freedom or another ideology, or going by gut feeling,
we must proceed as best we can.

## ðŸŽ“ Tutorials
I've written tutorials on [type systems](/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](/tutorial/session-types/)), [x86_64 binary reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/), and application security topics on [embedding malware in PDF files](/post/pdf-embedding-attacks/).

## ðŸ’¬ Culture & Practices
The culture, business, and sociology of technology fascinate me.

I've written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.
