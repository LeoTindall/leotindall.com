## ðŸ‘¤ About Me
Hi, I'm Leonora. I'm a full time student in computer science at [Beloit](https://beloit.edu).
I build and break open source software for fun.

You can find me on the <a href="https://cybre.space/@tindall" rel="me">Fediverse</a>, on <a href="https://github.com/NoraCodes" rel="me">GitHub</a>, on <a href="https://patreon.com/noracodes" rel="me">Patreon</a>, at nora AT nora DOT codes, and everywhere, with my <a href="/leonoratindall.asc" rel="pgpkey authn">PGP Key</a> and [other keys](/keys).

### ðŸ’¼ Experience

**Software Engineering Intern** at **CancerIQ, Inc.** during **Summer 2018.**
I developed user interface components and designed algorithms used to analyze health data,
as well as working with DevOps technologies including Kubernetes, Apache Kafka, Prometheus,
and Grafana.

**Software Engineering Intern** at **GudTech, Inc.** during **Summer 2017.**
I used agile methodology to work with a small team, gaining experience with Go and the 
inner workings of Docker in a Service Oriented Architecture environment. I created a
developer tooling used for onboarding and external (SDK) development.

This is a selection of my experience. See my [full resume](/resume.pdf) for more,
including volunteer positions and college work experience.

### ðŸ’» Code

I write systems code in [**Rust**](/categories/rust) and **Go**,
scripts and utilities in [**Python**](/categories/python) and **Lua**, and
websites in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I've written or contributed significantly to:

- [Open Energy Dashboard](https://github.com/OpenEnergyDashboard/OED), a multi-platform energy meter data visualization software built with Node.js, React, and Redux.
- [rloris](https://github.com/NoraCodes/rloris), a Rust implementation of layer 7 HTTP DoS attacks leveraging fearless concurrency
- [Evolve SBrain](https://github.com/NoraCodes/evolve-sbrain), a Rust genetic programming engine using the SBrain programming language
- [RandomUA](https://github.com/NoraCodes/RandomUA), a browser extension designed to enhance privacy by changing the user's reported browser software
- [workctl](https://github.com/NoraCodes/workctl), a Rust library for multithreaded programming, exposing useful mid-level building blocks
- [libUI-rs](https://github.com/rust-native-ui/libui-rs), Rust bindings to platform APIs to enable Rusty GUI app development
- [More...](/projects)

## ðŸ“œ Writing
I've written tutorials on [type systems](/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](/tutorial/session-types/)), [binary reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/), and application security topics like [embedding malware in PDF files](/post/pdf-embedding-attacks/).

I've also written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.
