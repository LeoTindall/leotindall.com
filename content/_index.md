I'm Leo Tindall. I work with computer hardware and software, building tools and tech that
makes it easer for people to reclaim their lives from the Apples and Googles of the world.

I firmly believe that computers should belong to users, not their makers, and that as the
wizards of the information age, it is our duty to demystify technology and make it as
easy as possible for people to understand and fully control the data gathered for and
about them.

The majority of my code is licensed under an appropriate copyleft license; I prefer the
AGPL when it is applicable, but GPL can be acceptable for certain use-cases.

## Code

I write code, mostly in [Rust](/categories/rust), [Python](/categories/python), and Go, but also in C, Java (and Processing), JavaScript/TypeScript, various esolangs, Lua, [assembly](/categories/assembly), and many more. 
 
You can check out my [projects](projects/) to see what I've worked on in the past. The big ones are the [Open Energy Dashboard](https://oed.beloit.edu), FediDict, and [iui](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs).

## Tutorials

I also write _about_ code. I've created two virtual machines, [SBrain](/post/sbrain-an-extension-of-brainfzck/) and the [Machine Learning VM](http://localhost:1313/post/mlem-a-vm-for-genetic-programming/), written about [type systems](http://localhost:1313/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](http://localhost:1313/tutorial/session-types/)). I also have a lot of general writing on programming and useful libraries for various languages under the [programming category](/categories/programming).

If you're interested in x86 hacking, my [reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) tutorial is a great place to start.

## Culture & Practices

The culture, business, and sociology of technology fascinate me, and I've written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.

## Hardware

I occasionally build actual, physical stuff, mostly small RC aircraft and hacking kit.

I also really like [retro computing hardware](/post/the-sinclair-zx-81-ts-1000/), but generally don't have the time or money to indulge this interest.

## Around the 'Net

In terms of social media, I'm exclusively available on the [Fediverse](https://cybre.space/@tindall).
