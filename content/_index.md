# Leo Tindall
## Senior Frobnication Engineer

This is the personal website of Leo Tindall, a systems and web programmer with a penchant
for strong type systems, lightweight interfaces, and optimization.

### TL;DR I teach computers to do tricks, and write about software and culture.

## Code

I write code, mostly in [Rust](/categories/rust), [Python](/categories/python), and Go, but also in C, Java (and Processing), JavaScript/TypeScript, various esolangs, Lua, [assembly](/categories/assembly), and many more. 
 
You can check out my [projects](projects/) to see what I've worked on in the past. The big ones are the [Open Energy Dashboard](https://oed.beloit.edu), FediDict, and [iui](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs).

## Tutorials

I also write _about_ code. I've created two [virtual](/post/sbrain-an-extension-of-brainfzck/) [machines](http://localhost:1313/post/mlem-a-vm-for-genetic-programming/), written about [type systems](http://localhost:1313/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be [done with them](http://localhost:1313/tutorial/session-types/), and [more](/categories/programming).

If you're interested in x86 hacking, my [reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) tutorial is a great place to start.

## Culture & Practices

The culture, business, and sociology of technology fascinate me, and I've written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.

## Hardware

I occasionally build actual, physical stuff, mostly small RC aircraft and hacking kit.

I also really like [retro computing hardware](/post/the-sinclair-zx-81-ts-1000/), but generally don't have the time or money to indulge this interest.

## Around the 'Net

In terms of social media, I'm exclusively available on the [Fediverse](https://cybre.space/@tindall).

If you'd like to support me, you can hire me by checking out my
[LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/leo-tindall/) or throw me a few bucks in exchange for
early access via my [Patreon](https://patreon.com/leotindall).

 I host some web services, like Etherpad and a Git VCS server along with project management tools. If you become a Patreon donor, you'll gain access to these services.
