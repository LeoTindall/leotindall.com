## The Personal Site of Leo Tindall

### Systems. Software. Silliness.

 This is the personal blog and web hub of **Leo F.S. Tindall**, a digital native
 hailing from {North Carolina, Texas, California}. I'm a software developer
 who aspires to a theorietical and practical understanding of both the human
 and technical sides of software.

 My preferred programming languages are **Rust**, **Go**, **Python 3**, and
 **C#**. I am an advocate of free and open source software and explicit,
 engineered codes of conduct for online communities.

 I’m currently a student at Beloit College, studying computer science. I love
 programming, but I’m also into sci-fi, tabletop gaming, literature, socialogy,
 politics, and social justice work.

 You can find my various social media links at the bottom of this page. I tend
 to stay away from most corporate/nonfree social media, so GNUSocial (Mastodon)
 or e-mail is your best bet for contacting me.
