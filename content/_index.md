Hi, I'm Leonora.

{{< div "intro-paragraph" >}}
You can call me Nora, if you like.

I'm a full time student in computer science at [Beloit](https://beloit.edu).

I build and break open source software for fun.

## âš– Ethics
It is the duty of software engineers to build software in an ethical way. In short:

- computer systems should serve their users before their makers
- software should empower users, not restrict them
- users should decide how data is used before engineers or businesspeople

Whether it means embracing software freedom or another ideology, or going by gut feeling,
we must proceed as best we can.

## ðŸ–¥  Hardware

I occasionally build actual, physical stuff, mostly small RC aircraft and hacking kit. Thanks to this hobby I

I also really like [retro computing hardware](/post/the-sinclair-zx-81-ts-1000/), but generally don't have the time or money to indulge this interest.

## ðŸŽ“ Tutorials
I've written tutorials on [type systems](/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](/tutorial/session-types/).) 

If you're interested in x86 hacking, my [reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) tutorial is a great place to start. For a more application-level security discussion, check out my post on [embedding malware in PDF files](/post/pdf-embedding-attacks/).

## ðŸ’¬ Culture & Practices
The culture, business, and sociology of technology fascinate me.

I've written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.

## ðŸ’½ IPFS

This website is also [available on IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmSzXMBKA55NfpBH9wX4pfkJcRL2UuDorBXaVN3CLpFGke/), a peer-to-peer content-addressed immutable datastore that spans the globe. I host a public IPFS gateway at [ipfs.leotindall.com](https://ipfs.leotindall.com/); you can also [view this blog](https://ipfs.leotindall.com/ipns/QmSzXMBKA55NfpBH9wX4pfkJcRL2UuDorBXaVN3CLpFGke/) through that gateway rather than the public resolver.
