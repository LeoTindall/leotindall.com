 I'm **Leo Tindall**, a systems and web programmer from San Diego.

 My preferred programming languages are **Rust**, **Go**, **Python 3**, and **JavaScript**/**TypeScript**. You can check out my [projects](projects/) to see what I've worked on in the past.

 I’m currently a student at Beloit College, studying computer science. I love programming, but I’m also into sci-fi, tabletop gaming, literature, socialogy, politics, and social justice work.

 You can find my various social media links at the bottom of this page. GNUSocial (Mastodon) or email is your best bet for contacting me.
