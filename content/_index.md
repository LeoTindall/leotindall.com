<span style="display: inline-block; font-size: 1.5em;">Software Engineer, Writer, and Free Software Advocate</span>

I'm Leo Tindall. I work with computer hardware and software, building tools and tech that
makes it easer for people to reclaim their lives from the Apples and Googles of the world.

I believe it is the duty of software engineers to build software in an ethical way. In short:

- computers should serve their users, not their makers
- software should empower, not restrict, user choices
- users, not engineers or businesspeople, should decide how data is used

We are the scribes of the information age, and it's our responsibility not to abuse the
positions of influence

## Code

I write systems code in [Rust](/categories/rust), [assembly](/categories/assembly), and Go, and a lot of scripts and utility software in [Python](/categories/python) and Lua.

I work on websites and web applications using CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript, but I have fundamental misgivings about the web platform as it stands., and many more. 

You can check out my [projects](projects/) to see what I've worked on in the past. The big ones are the [Open Energy Dashboard](https://oed.beloit.edu), FediDict, and [iui](https://github.com/LeoTindall/libui-rs).

## Tutorials
I've written tutorials on [type systems](/tutorial/a-gentle-introduction-to-practical-types/) and what can be done with them (for instance, [session types](/tutorial/session-types/).) 

I also have a lot of general writing on programming and useful libraries for various languages under the [programming category](/categories/programming).

If you're interested in x86 hacking, my [reverse engineering](/tutorial/an-intro-to-x86_64-reverse-engineering/) tutorial is a great place to start. For a more application-level security discussion, check out my post on [embedding malware in PDF files](/post/pdf-embedding-attacks/).

## Culture & Practices

The culture, business, and sociology of technology fascinate me, and I've written about topics ranging from [hacker superstitions](/post/hacker-superstitions/) and how spending way too much time customizing my desktop is [productive, actually](/post/modding-vim-i3-and-efficiency/) to [repairable hardware](/post/i-repaired-my-headphones/) and [free software](/post/open-source-for-normal-people/) and [why it matters](/post/a-story-about-my-personal-trainer/), for individuals and for [society](/post/deletefacebook-and-fosta/) as a whole.

## Hardware

I occasionally build actual, physical stuff, mostly small RC aircraft and hacking kit.

I also really like [retro computing hardware](/post/the-sinclair-zx-81-ts-1000/), but generally don't have the time or money to indulge this interest.

## IPFS

This website is also [available on IPFS](https://ipfs.io/ipns/QmSzXMBKA55NfpBH9wX4pfkJcRL2UuDorBXaVN3CLpFGke/), a peer-to-peer content-addressed immutable datastore that spans the globe. I host a public IPFS gateway at [ipfs.leotindall.com](https://ipfs.leotindall.com/); you can also [view this blog](https://ipfs.leotindall.com/ipns/QmSzXMBKA55NfpBH9wX4pfkJcRL2UuDorBXaVN3CLpFGke/) through that gateway rather than the public resolver.
