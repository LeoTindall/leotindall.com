## Hourly Working Rates

My general rate is $25/hr, billed on the half hour. The following exemptions apply:

* **Open source** work. Rates will be adjusted based on the specific job, to as little as $0/hr.
* **Non-profit** work. I will generally do pro-bono work for non profits if negotiated in advance.
* Work for **right wing** organizations. I charge an additional 125% fee for any organization promoting
    right-wing economic or socially conservative values.

I accept cash, check, or direct deposit. A reciept will be provided if requested. My general payment deadline is
60 days after the work is performed.

## Per Project Working Rates

If we have negotiated a per-project working rate, I expect any up-front percentage to be paid prior to work beginning,
and the remainder to be paid no more than 60 days after the project concludes, unless otherwise negotiated. I reserve
the right to use technological means to enforce this payment schedule, including but not limited to CSS kill switches,
account terminations, and banner advertisements.
